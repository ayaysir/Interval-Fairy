## Distribution and Planning

### Donwload Submitted File
- Please download the `Interval Fairy_Distribution.swiftpm.zip` file.
- Unzip and open the `.swiftpm` file in Xcode.

### Planning
- The status of the distribution `zip` file is as submitted to Apple.

## Introduction
It was created with the purpose of making it easy and fun to learn intervals in music theory through the Tamagotchi format. 
> In music theory, an interval is a difference in pitch between two sounds. An interval may be described as horizontal, linear, or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent pitches in a melody, and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such as in a chord.

There is a type called `quality` for interval, and there are Major, minor, Perfect, Augmented, and diminished, etc.
By inputting two notes using the embedded piano keyboard, you can make the character(fairy) happy, improve hygiene or health, or fill the satiety based on these `qualities`.

### What is the App's Target?
This app is aimed at anyone who wants to learn intervals easily.
Interval is the most fundamental foundation in music theory, and the subsequent process can proceed only when the interval is learned properly.
The later process of learning music theory can proceed only when the interval is learned properly, but the concept of interval is so complex that it is difficult to learn, which has hindered people who want to learn music theory.
So, I developed an app to help everyone who is experiencing these difficulties, albeit in a small way.

### Used Tech Stacks
This app is mostly written using the `Swift` language and `SwiftUI`. The part related to audio and music theory used the [AudioKit](https://github.com/AudioKit), an open source library. Graphics drawn by hand or licensed AI generated illustrations used.
